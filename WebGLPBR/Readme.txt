* get normal mapping working for texturing on

* then move to IBL!

* Make a PBR renderer in WebGL:
 * https://learnopengl.com/#!PBR/Theory

* option to animate light positions?

? should the various functions take arrays instead of x,y,z and r,g,b? i think so, would be easier

* TODO's!

* could animate lights and/or objects over time?

* make shader compiler do non blocking thing with webgl2 render fences
* Debug displays to see all the various buffers

* be able to load or define models somehow (or switch from spheres to boxes or tetrahedrons?)

* a starting image that says "click to begin. mouse look, WASD controls"
* a starting image that says "loading..." for image loading (and later, shader compilations)

* ambient occlusion of meshes, if using more complex meshes

! phong lighting may need to go. not sure if it's right.

* A drop down for diff scenes.
 * Sphere grid
 * Debug sphere? w/ sliders for properties and color?
 * Box (es)?
 * Tetrahedrons?
 * Bezier rectangle?

===== LATER =====

* blog post with links to resources, basic shell webgl pbr program, any programs you made or used.
* SSR
* shadow maps (temporal soft shadow maps from gpu pro 2?)
* Deferred rendering w/ gbuffer and forward rendering pass
* temporal AA / temporal super sampling / temporal filtering
* red/ blue 3d glasses mode
* spherical harmonics
* HDR tonemapping and bloom
* different depth formats (reversed, non linear, etc)
* subsurface scattering
* reflection / refraction / absorption / etc
* second specular lobe like in disney brdf
* and so on!
