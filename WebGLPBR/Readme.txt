* Make a PBR renderer in WebGL:
 * https://learnopengl.com/#!PBR/Theory

? make debug panel closed by default?

* Camera:
 * first person
 * overhead too

* put something meaningful in the debug panel that actually works, whenever it makes sense to.
 * maybe switching between camera styles?

* Blog posts with code and images along the way?

* make shader compiler do non blocking thing with webgl2 render fences
* Debug displays to see all the buffers
* resize window only when it changes?

===== LATER =====

* SSR
* shadow maps (temporal soft shadow maps from gpu pro 2?)
* Deferred rendering w/ gbuffer and forward rendering pass
* temporal AA / temporal super sampling / temporal filtering
* and so on!

===== DONE =====

--5/31/17
