* make basic shadows work.

* get a plane rendering
* get a sphere, box, cylinder rendering on that plane
* should i render a doughnut so there is a more complex shadow?
* point light, basic diffuse / specular shading (feels so wrong!)
* option to animate something: make objects move or something?
 * temporal stuff useless without.

? be able to switch between directional and positional light?
? debug options to view things? or should we have multiple windows?

? should we show FPS? probably not. if so, ditch the calculations

? sRGB correctness?

* some way to move the camera around
* get temporal stuff working from gpu pro 2

* link to blog post when done
