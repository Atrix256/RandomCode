* make there be one key for skyboxes, so we can make specular mips programatically too.

* make specular IBL work.
 * load in the custom mips.
 * make it use them in the specular stuff.
 * make it so you can see them, by choosing a skybox that shows them, like we can with diffuse

* the cube maps aren't seamless. probably bad source data. need to look into it. maybe we are improperly bicubically interpolating across face edges, or we aren't adding half a pixel or something



* make an instructional window that goes away when clicked. "click on the screen to enter mouse look mode.  WASD to move around, mouse to look.  escape to leave mouse look mode.  click on [-] to open the debug panel. Best viewed in chrome (?)"
 * test on other browsers.  See if escape is the way to exit for others too.

* check todos

* then move to specular IBL!

* after IBL, make it so PBR grid can use roughness of 0, not the minimum value it has.

* Make a PBR renderer in WebGL:
 * https://learnopengl.com/#!PBR/Theory

* add a model to the shape drop down list

* profile code to see where time is going so far

* TODO's!

* make shader compiler do non blocking thing with webgl2 render fences

* a starting image that says "click to begin. mouse look, WASD controls"
* an image that says "loading..." for image loading (and later, shader compilations)

* ambient occlusion of meshes, if using more complex meshes.
 * a program that does it, with a blog post about it!

! upload what you have so far to demofox.org?

? add an emissive texture? or get rid of emissive display maybe?

* after IBL, get rid of ambient light? or have a mode to turn off IBL and use ambient in that case?

* bezier rectangle later? (ray marched)

? orbit camera mode?

? is there a better way to get barycentrics in webgl?

? use the #define's to change the vertex format to be leaner when it can be?
 * or can we share the buffers better?

? load images on demand instead of in the beginning?

* try running webgl in renderdoc (launch chrome from renderdoc)
 * "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --allow-file-access-from-files
 * first attempt didn't work

* drop down menu for texture slots, with one main drop down for "presets" for the materials.
 * Yes get rid of untextured shader permutations after this and just use white textures etc?
  * or allow untextured still

* blog post on diffuse IBL at this point, with screenshots?
 * maybe save it for later when you understand the whole picture better.

? is it normal for colors to show up on metal when it shouldn't? ask SE. like red metal showing a green light.

* the PBR images you have are gigantic, at 9MB a pop.  Can you find some smaller ones? Or do they need to be this huge? Could be affecting perf.
 * maybe shrink em down to whatever you can get away with

===== LATER =====

* blog post with links to resources, basic shell webgl pbr program, any programs you made or used.
* SSR
* shadow maps (temporal soft shadow maps from gpu pro 2?)
* Deferred rendering w/ gbuffer and forward rendering pass
* temporal AA / temporal super sampling / temporal filtering
* red/ blue 3d glasses mode
* spherical harmonics
* HDR tonemapping and bloom
* different depth formats (reversed, non linear, etc)
* subsurface scattering
* reflection / refraction / absorption / etc
* second specular lobe like in disney brdf
* parallax bump mapping
* and so on!

? blend normals / tangent / bitangent across faces to make smoother normals?
 * make a flag to allow this or not.  The sphere would like it, but box and tetrahedron for example wouldn't.
 * probably need to move to index buffers if doing this, to find all faces to average across. a good idea anyways likely

* when surfaces get wet: https://seblagarde.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/water-drop-3b-physically-based-wet-surfaces/

===== NOTES =====

* Normal Mapping:
 * We could transform light positions etc into tangent space, in the vertex shader and pass as interpolants.
 * Instead of doing the TBN matrix multiply to transform the texture normal into world space.
 * That would save a matrix multiply in the pixel shader.
 * The goal is to go deferred at some point though, which would need world space normals, so leaving it like it is.
