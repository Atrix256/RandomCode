About the Sky
-------------
The sky is a night sky, so use a dim environment_light to fill the 
outside area that is covered by the sky. A color setting of 
255, 178, 192 works well, with a brightness of 5 to 15 to simulate
twilight.  The sun is on the west side, so set the environment_light's
angle to 0, with a pitch of -33. You can, of course, try other settings,
but I found these settings to work best.

The sky was made using a program called Terragen. Terragen can be found
at http://www.planetside.co.uk/terragen/. Registration is inexpensive,
and I highly recommend that if you plan to make your own skies, download
register this program.
